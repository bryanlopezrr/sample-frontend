# rock-paper-scissors
This is going to be my rock-paper-scissors project that I will practice and work on multiple technologies with. Its meant to be trivial at first but get complex with time 


# Branching Strategy
Devs will create their branch off ```Dev``` branch.\
Changes are then Merged to ```Dev``` once done with their feature.\
```Merge``` Changes from ```Dev``` to ```main``` for prod. release

## Branching Feature
we will use the ```feature-<name>``` naming convention.

Example: ```feature-fbLogin```
